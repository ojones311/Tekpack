            <p>It takes 2,000 gallons of water to make the jeans you are wearing right now, you wouldn’t believe it.
                Nobody ever really thinks what it took to make a piece of clothing we just like it and buy it.
                That is one of the problems in the fashion world, textile dyeing it's the second largest polluter of
                water globally and 73% of theset extiles end up in landfills or burned because they are unusable.
                 Miscommunication between designer and factory supplier also contribute to textile waste.
                 <br/>
                 Some issues they face:
                <or>    
                    <li>Design and specification inaccuracy</li>
                    <li>Lost samples and specification sheets in mail and emails</li>
                    <li>Hard to manage hard copy files for each product</li>
                </or>
            </p>
            <p>
                Tekpack is your one stop shop to manage and keep track of all product specifications and its related content seamlessly.
                 The whole process will cut down on waste in the supply chain and prevent costly mistakes in production. We’ve created a simple 
                 user interface that helps designers troubleshoot before any fabric is cut. These can be made with real time updates and reduce 
                 human error to create a better communication flow between designer and factory. A user can also upload their own design
                  and changes, they can upload a modified sketch that will be updated instantly for all parties associated on the project. 
                  Also for designers we’ve added an template option where they can choose from one of our basic templates. Further increasing 
                  productivity when working on designs with similar specs.

                        on designers projects.</li>
                    <li> Designers sketches will be 3D and dynamic where once a measurement is inputed the image would display the input in real time.</li>
                    <li>Add an Export option where suppliers are able to export the spec sheet as a PDF or just the measurements as an excel
                        sheet for printing purposes.</li>
                    <li>Be able to leave comment on projects</li>
                    <li>Save measurements under specific projects</li>
